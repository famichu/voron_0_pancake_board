# Pancake Board

## Incomplete forked project

Will be a 2x8 Micro-fit 3
Molex 1x2 (43650) connector for the Hotend
Molex 1x2 (43650) & JST PH dual footprint for thermistor (for Revo compatibility)

Net classes and rules not yet assigned. I need to make sure we have very very large traces (around 2mm) for the hotend to carry up to 5A (Rapido)
